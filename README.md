### Meet Evan Kessler

Hello! My name is Evan Kessler and I am a Senior at Clemson University. Currently, I am the lead teacher's assistant for CPSC 1060 (Introduction to Java) at Clesmon University's School of Computing under Dr. Adkins.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on new autograders and projects for my TA job for the CPSC 1060 Spring semester, along with a plethora of other projects such as expanding my knowledge of React.JS through updating my CPSC 3720 Notid project. I hope to use this React knowledge to start coding dApps in Web3 environments, and learning smart contracts.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning artificial intelligence algorithms for unmanned vehicles and other applications in Python, operating systems in C, applied data science, and database management with SQL. 

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: my phone number is 732-320-0158, my personal email is evkessler2002@gmail.com, my school email is etkessl@clemson.edu, and my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-kessler-30b1331aa/) is under Evan Kessler.

- :orange_book: Current interests: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Software Engineering, Applied Data Science, Web3 (Smart Contracts and dApps), Quantum Computing (from the quantum physics side and from the algorithmic side), and creative projects to help incoming CS students at Clemson learn how to code.
